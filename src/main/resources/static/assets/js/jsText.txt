if(paging && $scope.pageNumber){} ==  this is to check so that when user clicks on paging links and no record have been 
fetched b4 no request shd be sent. when page is loaded no records have been set. so why click next or previous. where are 
you going? ideally i shd disable them i just don't want to go this way since i have to enable them in the code again.
also note that getFGTransactions(pageNumber+1,496) ie the pagination calls takes a dummy parameter. this enables me to 
know that click is coming from pagination links. that is why i test if(paging && $scope.pageNumber). $scope.pageNumber this 
also helps me since when page is loaded no pageNumber exists.
